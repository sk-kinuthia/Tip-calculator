## Overview
This was a very nice challenge. Took me a while due to the javascript functionality that had to be integrated into the app, but overall it's a good 
challenge for any aspiring web developer who would like to get their feet wet with  javascript.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

## My process
As always, I work with a mobile first workflow
So:
- I first analyze the designs, both the desktop and mobile designs.
- Then I identify how the breakpoints for the mobile design and the desktop design will work, to understand how to structure the html
- Then I write the html for the project, add the styles for both mobile and desktop
- Then add the javascript funtionality


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I have learned alot from this project, first thing being, it is not easy, but with practice and consistency, I will get there.
Also, javascript is what brings our websites to life, making them interactive, and I am happy to learn and work on more projects with the awesome power of javacript.

I have also learned how to validate user input using custom error messages in js,
by using the concept of adding and removing specific classes in the html elements


### Continued development

From here on out, I want to continue learning and practicing with javascript, so I'll try to complete a javascript project every other day.
